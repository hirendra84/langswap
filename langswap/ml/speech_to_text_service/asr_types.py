# Minimum silence (seconds) that counts as a real, dubbing-relevant pause.
# 0.25 s is the standard prosodic-phrase boundary: above the ~0.18 s stop-closure
# of voiceless consonants (so we don't split on articulation) yet low enough to
# keep every linguistically meaningful pause. Splitting here makes the silence a
# gap *between* segments, which is the only pause the downstream merge reinserts.
# NOTE: keep this in sync with the _remap_pauses default in speech_to_text_manager.py.
